= Configuring hosted control planes on a dual stack network (Technology Preview)

In the context of hosted control planes, a disconnected environment is an {ocp-short} cluster that is not connected to the internet and that uses hosted control planes as a base. You can configure hosted control planes on a dual-stack network in a disconnected environment only, because the remote registries do not function with IPv6.

Review the following steps to configure hosted control planes on a dual-stack network:  

. Configure the hypervisor for a dual-stack network
. Configuring DNS for a dual-stack network
. Deploying a registry for a dual-stack network
. Setting up a management cluster for a dual-stack network
. Configuring the web server for a dual-stack network
. Configuring image mirroring for a dual-stack network
. Deploying {mce-short} for a dual-stack network
. Configuring TLS certificates for a dual-stack network
. Deploying the hosted cluster for a dual-stack network
. Finishing the deployment for a dual-stack network
