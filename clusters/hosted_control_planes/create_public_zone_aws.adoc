= Creating a routable public zone

To access applications in your guest clusters, the public zone must be routable. If the public zone exists, skip this step. Otherwise, the public zone will affect the existing functions.

Run the following command to create a public zone for cluster DNS records:

----
aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name <your-basedomain> --caller-reference $(whoami)-$(date --rfc-3339=date)
----

Replace `your-basedomain` with your base domain, for example, `www.example.com`.
