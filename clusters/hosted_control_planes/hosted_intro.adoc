= Hosted control planes

With {mce-short} cluster management, you can deploy {ocp-short} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or hosted control planes. The standalone configuration uses dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the {ocp-short} control plane. With hosted control planes for {ocp-short}, you create control planes as pods on a hosting cluster without the need for dedicated physical machines for each control plane.

Hosted control planes for {ocp-short} are available on bare metal and {ocp-virt}, and as a **Technology Preview** feature on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can host the control planes on {ocp-short} version 4.14. The hosted control planes feature is enabled by default.

Hosted control plane clusters offer several advantages:

* Saves cost by removing the need to host dedicated control plane nodes

* Introduces separation between the control plane and the workloads, which improves isolation and reduces configuration errors that can require changes

* Decreases the cluster creation time by removing the requirement for control plane node bootstrapping

* Supports turn-key deployments or fully customized {ocp-short} provisioning

[#hosted-control-requirements]
== Requirements

The following table indicates which {ocp-short} versions are supported for each platform. In the table, _Hosting {ocp-short} version_ refers to the {ocp-short} version where {mce-short} is enabled:

|===
| Platform | Hosting {ocp-short} version | Hosted {ocp-short} version
| Bare metal | 4.14 - 4.15 | 4.14 - 4.15 (only)
| {ocp-virt} | 4.14 - 4.15 | 4.14 - 4.15 (only)
| AWS (Technology Preview) | 4.11 - 4.15 | 4.14 - 4.15 (only)
|===

**Note:** The hub cluster and workers must run on the same platform for hosted control planes. In addition, the hosting cluster and workers must run on the same infrastructure. For example, you cannot run your hosting cluster on bare metal and your workers on the cloud.

The control plane runs as pods that are contained in a single namespace and is associated with the hosted cluster. When {ocp-short} creates a hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane.
