= Verifying hosted cluster creation

After the deployment process is complete, you can verify that the hosted cluster was created successfully. Follow these steps a few minutes after you create the hosted cluster.

. Obtain the kubeconfig for your new hosted cluster by entering the extract command:

+
----
oc extract -n <hosted-cluster-namespace> secret/<hosted-cluster-name>-admin-kubeconfig --to=- > kubeconfig-<hosted-cluster-name>
----

. Use the kubeconfig to view the cluster Operators of the hosted cluster. Enter the following command:

+
----
oc get co --kubeconfig=kubeconfig-<hosted_cluster_name>
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----

----
oc get pods -A --kubeconfig=kubeconfig-<hosted-cluster-name>
