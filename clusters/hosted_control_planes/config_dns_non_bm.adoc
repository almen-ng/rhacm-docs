[#configure-dns-non-bm]
= Configuring DNS on non bare metal agent machines

The API Server for the hosted cluster is exposed as a `NodePort` service. A DNS entry must exist for `api.${HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASEDOMAIN}` that points to destination where the API Server can be reached.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the managed cluster that is running the hosted control plane. The entry can also point to a load balancer that is deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the ingress pods.

* See the following example DNS configuration:

+
----
api-int.example.krnl.es.    IN A 192.168.122.22
`*`.apps.example.krnl.es. IN A 192.168.122.23
----

* If you are configuring DNS for a disconnected environment on an IPv6 network, see the following example DNS configuration:

+
----
api-int.example.krnl.es.    IN A 2620:52:0:1306::7
`*`.apps.example.krnl.es. IN A 2620:52:0:1306::10
----

* If you are configuring DNS for a disconnected environment on a dual stack network, be sure to include DNS entries for both IPv4 and IPv6. See the following example DNS configuration:

+
----
host-record=api-int.hub-dual.dns.base.domain.name,2620:52:0:1306::2
address=/apps.hub-dual.dns.base.domain.name/2620:52:0:1306::3
dhcp-host=aa:aa:aa:aa:10:01,ocp-master-0,[2620:52:0:1306::5]
