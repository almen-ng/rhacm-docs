[#enable-machine-health-checks-bm]
= Enabling machine health checks on bare metal

You can enable machine health checks on bare metal to repair and replace unhealthy managed cluster nodes automatically. You must have additional agent machines that are ready to install in the managed cluster.

Consider the following limitations before enabling machine health checks:

* You cannot modify the `MachineHealthCheck` object.
* Machine health checks replace nodes only when at least two nodes stay in the `False` or `Unknown` status for more than 8 minutes.

After you enable machine health checks for the managed cluster nodes, the `MachineHealthCheck` object is created in your hosted cluster.

To enable machine health checks in your hosted cluster, modify the `NodePool` resource. Complete the following steps:

. Verify that the `spec.nodeDrainTimeout` value in your `NodePool` resource is greater than `0s`. Replace `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with the name of your hosted cluster namespace and `<nodepool_name>` with the node pool name. Run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get nodepool -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <nodepool_name> -o yaml | grep nodeDrainTimeout
----

+
See the following example output:

+
----
nodeDrainTimeout: 30s
----

. If the `spec.nodeDrainTimeout` value is not greater than `0s`, modify the value by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch nodepool -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <nodepool_name> -p '{"spec":{"nodeDrainTimeout": "30m"}}' --type=merge
----

. Enable machine health checks by setting the `spec.management.autoRepair` field to `true` in the `NodePool` resource. Run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch nodepool -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <nodepool_name> -p '{"spec": {"management": {"autoRepair":true}}}' --type=merge
----

. Verify that the `NodePool` resource is updated with the `autoRepair: true` value by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get nodepool -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <nodepool_name> -o yaml | grep autoRepair
----

[#disable-machine-health-checks-bm]
== Disabling machine health checks on bare metal

To disable machine health checks for the managed cluster nodes, modify the `NodePool` resource. Complete the following steps:

. Disable machine health checks by setting the `spec.management.autoRepair` field to `false` in the `NodePool` resource. Run the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc patch nodepool -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <nodepool_name> -p '{"spec": {"management": {"autoRepair":false}}}' --type=merge
----

. Verify that the `NodePool` resource is updated with the `autoRepair: false` value by running the following command:

+
[source,bash]
----
oc get nodepool -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> <nodepool_name> -o yaml | grep autoRepair
----
