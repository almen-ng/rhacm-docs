= Troubleshooting search database

If search or the application topology are missing clusters, it could be that the search data got out of sync.

To workaround this issue, complete the following steps:

. Restart the `search-indexer` pod in `open-cluster-management` namespace. 
. Go to the  _Application_ page, select your application. 
. To verify that the cluster is displayed,  switch to the *Topology* view.
