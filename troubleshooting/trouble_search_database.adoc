= Troubleshooting search database

If your application topology has missing clusters, but your clusters are actually active, the issue might be that the cluster nodes are not found in the search database. 

To workaround this issue, complete the following steps:

. Restart the indexer pod. 
. Go to your application topology and verify that the clusters are there.
