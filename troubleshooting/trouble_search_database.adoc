= Troubleshooting search database

If you are missing clusters from application topology, but your clusters are actually active, the issue might be that the cluster nodes are not found in the search database. 

To workaround this issue, complete the following steps:

. Restart the `search-indexer` pod in `open-cluster-management` namespace. 
. Go to your application page, select your application, then switch to the *Topology* view. 
. Verify that the clusters are there.
