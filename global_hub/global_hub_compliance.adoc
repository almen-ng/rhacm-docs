= Running the summarization process manually

You can manually run the summarization process to help you investigate a problem or get a report sooner than the next scheduled routine. To manually run the summarization process complete the following steps: 

. Use the earlier day's history as the initial state for the recover day's history. 
. Connect to the database.
+ 
You can use clients such as pgAdmin and tablePlush to connect to the {global-hub} database. Or, you can directly connect to the database on the cluster by running the following command:
+
----
kubectl exec -it multicluster-global-hub-postgres-0 -n multicluster-global-hub -- psql -d hoh
----
       
. Decide the date when you want the summarization process to run, for example: `2023-07-06` 
+
Find the local compliance job failure information from the dashboard metrics or the table, `history.local_compliance_job_log`. In this example, the date is, `2023-07-07`, so you know that `2023-07-06` is the date when you need to manually run the summary processes.

. Recover the initial compliance of `2023-07-06` by running the following SQL: 
+
----
-- call the func to generate the initial data of '2023-07-07' by inheriting '2023-07-06'
CALL history.generate_local_compliance('2024-07-07');
