== Errata 2.10.3

* Fixes an issue when a policy was recreated quickly after deletion, it sometimes led to the compliance status not being populated on the managed cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10664[ACM-10664])

* Fixes a bug where a `ConfigurationPolicy` with the `MustOnlyHave` compliance type did not factor root-level keys in the object on the cluster when comparing it to the policy definition. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10877[ACM-10877])

* Fixes an issue in the Policy Generator where some placement overrides that exist outside of `policyDefaults` did not correctly override. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-11075[ACM-11075])

* Fixes an issue where the `OperatorPolicy` compliance message changed rapidly with the same message but with a different order because an operator installation failed with multiple errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-11204[ACM-11204])

* Added a missing log message reporting the error when the `ConfigurationPolicy` controller failed to make a dry-run update when comparing the policy with the object on the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10612[ACM-10612])

* Fixes an issue that caused some unnecessary logs in the `governance-policy-framework` pod to be displayed with the default log verbosity settings. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10693[ACM-10693])

* Delivers updates to one or more product container images.

== Errata 2.10.2

* Fixes an issue where the `multicluster-observability-controller` did not reconcile after an update or deletion of its `AddOnDeploymentConfig` add-on. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10406[ACM-10406])

* Fixes an issue where the `multicluster-observability-controller` did not change to the configuration that was set in the `nodePlacement` field of its `AddOnDeploymentConfig` add-on. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10811[ACM-10811])

* Fixes an upgrading issue in the `multicluster-observability-controller` that caused the continuous update of a `ServiceAccount`. The continuous update caused multiple `Secret` objects to be generated over time. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10967[ACM-10967])

* Delivers updates to one or more product container images. 

== Errata 2.10.1

* Fixes a problem that might occur for users who use the {product-title} backup and recovery function and backed up the `managedcluster` namespace without using the `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/backup: cluster-activation` label. The problem caused the managed cluster namespace to remain in the `Terminating` state after it is restored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-9780[ACM-9780])

* Fixes the issue where a policy might temporarily be set to `noncompliant` with a message of `context cancelled` when the policy was being updated, while the `governance-policy-framework` pod was shutting down on the managed cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10402[ACM-10402])

* Fixes a problem that sometimes caused the console to briefly show a newly created policy as not found before refreshing to the policy details. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-10416[ACM-10416])

* Delivers updates to one or more product container images.
